# License Plate Recorder Requirements for Jetson Nano Orin
# Optimized for ARM64 architecture and CUDA support

# Core dependencies for computer vision and AI (Jetson-optimized)
# Note: OpenCV will be provided by system packages (python3-opencv)
ultralytics>=8.0.0
numpy>=1.21.0,<1.25.0  # Compatible with Jetson
torch>=1.11.0  # Will use Jetson PyTorch wheels
torchvision>=0.12.0  # Will use Jetson torchvision wheels

# License plate detection and OCR (uses system onnxruntime-gpu)
fast-alpr>=0.3.0

# Tracking and computer vision utilities
supervision>=0.16.0

# Configuration and utilities
pyyaml>=6.0
Pillow>=9.0.0,<10.0.0  # Compatible version for ARM64
scipy>=1.7.0,<1.10.0  # Jetson-compatible version
psutil>=5.9.0

# GStreamer Python bindings (already installed via system packages)
PyGObject>=3.42.0

# Build tools and utilities
setuptools>=60.0.0
wheel>=0.37.0

# Optional: For better performance monitoring on Jetson
# jetson-stats  # Already installed in base image

# Note: Some packages are intentionally omitted or version-constrained for Jetson compatibility:
# - opencv-contrib-python: Will use system OpenCV instead
# - Latest numpy versions: Can cause conflicts with system packages
# - torch/torchvision: Should use official Jetson wheels when available
